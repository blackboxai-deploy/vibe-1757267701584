# Smart Resume Reviewer - Implementation TODO

## Core Setup
- [x] Install additional dependencies (OpenAI, PDF processing libraries)
- [x] Create TypeScript interfaces for resume analysis
- [x] Set up OpenAI client configuration
- [x] Create PDF parsing utilities

## Core Components Development
- [x] Create main application layout (src/app/layout.tsx)
- [x] Build main page interface (src/app/page.tsx)
- [x] Develop ResumeUploader component (drag-and-drop + text input)
- [x] Build JobRoleSelector component (predefined roles + custom input)
- [x] Create AnalysisResults component (structured feedback display)
- [x] Build LoadingSpinner component
- [x] Create PrivacyDisclaimer component

## Backend API Development
- [x] Create PDF parsing API endpoint (src/app/api/parse-pdf/route.ts)
- [x] Build resume analysis API endpoint (src/app/api/analyze-resume/route.ts)
- [x] Implement LLM analysis logic with structured prompts
- [x] Add error handling and rate limiting

## Features Implementation
- [x] File upload validation and security
- [x] PDF text extraction functionality
- [x] Multi-aspect resume analysis (structure, content, ATS compatibility)
- [x] Job-role-specific feedback generation
- [x] Section-wise scoring system
- [x] Visual feedback components (progress bars, ratings)

## Image Processing (AUTOMATIC)
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) â†’ AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing

## Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Install dependencies and resolve any conflicts
- [ ] Build application with error resolution
- [ ] Test PDF upload functionality
- [ ] Test text input functionality
- [ ] Validate OpenAI integration and LLM analysis
- [ ] Test complete resume analysis workflow
- [ ] API endpoint testing with curl commands
- [ ] Performance and error handling validation
- [ ] Start production server and generate preview URL

## Security & Privacy
- [ ] Implement secure file handling (temporary processing)
- [ ] Add privacy disclaimers
- [ ] Validate input sanitization
- [ ] Test file deletion after processing
